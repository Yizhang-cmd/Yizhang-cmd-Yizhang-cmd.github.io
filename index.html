    <p>Hi, I'm Yizhang Zhu, a third-year Interactive Arts and Technology (IAT) student at SFU. My studies have led me through various creative projects, from brand book design and storyboarding to sound editing. Currently, I’m working on projects in 3D modeling and animation. Beyond school, I enjoy spending time outdoors with activities like whale watching, biking, and filming. I'm an RPG video game fan and worked in food delivery during the pandemic, which gave me a different perspective on community. Lately, I've taken an interest in stock trading. Music also plays a big role in my life, with Muse, Daft Punk, Gorillaz, and Twenty One Pilots being a few of my go-to bands.</p>

      <p>This presentation is about introducing Organic Ocean, a sustainable seafood company I designed the branding for. I discuss the company’s commitment to environmental responsibility and supporting fishermen, highlighting key elements of the brand book like our logo, color choices, and marketing materials. I explain our goals, design process, and the ways we communicate with customers through our website and social media. The presentation wraps up by inviting the audience to connect with us and learn more about our eco-friendly seafood offerings.</p>

      <p>My storyboard follows the storyline of Finding Nemo, depicting Marlin and Nemo’s heartfelt reunion and the strength of their bond. The story’s tension builds when Dory is captured in a large net with other fish, prompting Nemo to courageously attempt a rescue. This act of bravery inspires the other fish, who unite in a collective effort to break free from the net. The climax reaches its peak as they all pull together to escape, underscoring themes of courage and teamwork. In the resolution, Marlin and Nemo return to their peaceful life with a stronger bond. With minimal dialogue, the storyboard relies on powerful visuals to carry the narrative, emphasizing the emotional and dramatic moments of their journey.</p>

      <p>This work is set at a railway crossing in a small coastal town. It begins with the sound of birds chirping and cars speeding by. Then, a cyclist and a pedestrian pulling a wagon cart cross the street. In the background, you can hear seagulls, startled by the distant train horn. As the train approaches, the railway crossing signals begin to ring, cars stop, and the birds, frightened by the loud noise, fly away. Their chirping only returns after the train has passed and the crossing is clear. The seagulls at the beginning, too, react to the train horn by flying off in alarm. As the train passes, all other sounds are drowned out by the roar of the train itself. This piece simulates the scene of a busy railway crossing, capturing how animals and the environment respond to the overwhelming presence of the train, and it is inspired by my personal experience.</p>
